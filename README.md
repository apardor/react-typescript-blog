  :mailbox_with_no_mail:
  Fetching posts with React and TypeScript
  :mailbox_closed:
</h2>  

### 


This project fetches data from https://dummyjson.com/posts. It connects with data from 5 different categories and it displays each category on a clearly separated section. A ENUM is used to 'enumarate' the different categories and iterate through them to create each section.

Each section is created with accordions that display the posts as a list of cards
